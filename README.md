# Android Modules Clean Architecture [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3e9bbcba7b3945f4b9ba0887b8639a00)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

2 Android Apps that use the same core logic, featuring Clean Architecture, Kotlin.

# Features

1. **Login**
2. **Movie List**
3. **Movie detail**
4. **Pagination**
5. **Pull to Refresh**

# Variants

Both apps have two variants: **develop**, **uat**, and **product**.

## The Motivation behind the app
This repository was created with the intention of sharing knowledge and using it to implement new challenges and ideas.

## Movies Mock Server API

**API:** [Movies Mock Server](https://movies-mock-server.vercel.app/)

This API is the primary data source for the app, providing a mock database of movie information. It is designed to mimic real-world data operations including fetching, updating, and managing movie data.

**API Repository:** [Movies Mock Server Repository](https://github.com/AliAsadi/movies-mock-server)

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the Movies Mock Server API

# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer â€” the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.

# Architecture Layers

The application consists of three layers:

The domain layer, the data layer, and the presentation layer.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [Paging3](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Load and display small chunks of data at a time.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Navigate fragments easier.

- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android application.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) - For Mocking and Unit Testing

## ðŸ’Ž Code Style

The code style in this project was ensured using [Detekt](https://detekt.dev/).

**Check command:**

```
./gradlew detekt
```

## ðŸ”® Improvement
- Implement Unit-test & test coverage report
- Handle Error
- Add more screen feature
- Local CI with githooks: ktlint, detekt
